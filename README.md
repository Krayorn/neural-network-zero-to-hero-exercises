# Neural Network: from zero to hero

This is the exercises from Andrej Karpathy's [Neural Networks: from Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ).

[The original notebooks from the lectures](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero/tree/master).

I've written and splitted a bit more the exercices in this [blog post](https://www.krayorn.com/posts/zero-to-hero-neural-networks-bigram-trigram-language-models/). 

The exercises are commented in my implementation and the difficulties I encounterd are also mentionned in case it can help some readers. 

If something is weird or not comprehensible, feel free to shoot me a DM on twitter.
